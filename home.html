    <p class="lead">I understand your frustration. It can be challenging to navigate the 
        scholarship application process and find resources that meet your 
        specific needs. While I may not be able to provide the exact answers 
        you were looking for, I hope my guidance on crafting good scholarship 
        questions will be helpful in the long run. If you would like to try a 
        different approach, perhaps you could share some of the questions you 
        have already formulated. I could then offer feedback on how to make 
        them more specific, clear, or effective in eliciting the information 
        you seek. Ultimately, my goal is to be a helpful and informative 
        resource. If there's anything else I can do to assist you, please don't
        hesitate to ask.
